# Azure Backup

If for any reason, the local llm solution does not work, or a more capable model is needed, you can use the azure module to make requests to a model hosted on Azure.
Azure is a platform by Microsoft, that among other things, allows to host LLMs and access them via API. THis is the way we host our models for production code.

You can sue the template in .\code_examples/09_azure-backup.py.
I will send you the API-Key if needed.
The API will be open until Friday afternoon if you want to complete your project or play around a bit.
